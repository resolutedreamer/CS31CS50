The problem is that as presented, the pointer is passed by value, not passed by reference, so when the function finishes running, the copy of the pointer p is destroyed, and the actual pointer ptr in the main routine was not changed at all. I add the & sign so that the variable p is passed by references.

void findDisorder(int arr[], int n, int* &p)

        for (int k = 1; k < n; k++)
        {
            if (arr[k] < arr[k-1])
            {
                 p = arr + k;
                 return;
            }
        }
	p = NULL;
}
