The problem here is that the match function is not actually comparing the characters of the strings, because the match function is not looking at entries of the array, but it is trying to instead compare the arrays themselves. I add a loop so that the function will actually go through the entries of the different arrays.

bool match(const char str1[], const char str2[])
{
	int i = 0;
	while (1)
	{
		while (str1[i] != '\0'  &&  str2[i] != '\0')  // zero bytes at ends
		{
			if (str1[i] != str2[i])  // compare corresponding characters
				return false;
			i++;            // advance to the next character
		}
		return !(strcmp(str1, str2));   // both ended at same time?
	}
}
