1. The output produced by the following program segment is:
endlendl
grendel
2. The program up for consideration asks the user to enter a number, and then the program writes out a number sign that at that many spaces away from the beginning of the line, and then on the next line, outputs a number sign one space closer to the beginning, and the same on subsequent lines, until the number sign is on the first line.
for example, for the user inputing the number 6, the output looks like

Enter a number: 6
     #
    #
   #
  #
 #
#
3.
#include <iostream>
	using namespace std;

	int main()
	{
	    int len;

	    cout << "Enter a number: ";
	    cin >> len;

	    for (int i = 0; i < len; i++)
	    {
		int j=1;
		while ((len != 0) && (!(len < 0 )) && (i+j < len));
		{
		    cout << " ";
			j++;
		}
				
		
		cout << "#" << endl;
	    }
	}
